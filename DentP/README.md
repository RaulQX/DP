# Dentistry

This is a personal project where I apply what I learned in a tutorial in order to build a single-page-application for a dentistry.

## Built With

* [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
* [React.js](https://reactjs.org/)
* [Styled-components](https://styled-components.com)

## Learning Path

- React functional components and their reusability
- React file and folder structure
- Styled Components

### Notes

- This Web project is a front-end only single-page application, created with the intent of practicing the above mentioned.
- The only dependencies are react-icons and styled-components
- Lots of thanks to Javascript Mastery for the amazing courses they provide!
